    title: About Me
    summary: |
      I am Dominik a computer science student at ETH. I am always looking for opportunities to
      learn more and jump out of my comfortzone. My main focus is on machine learning.
       However, I try to gain knowledge in many areas. I could demonstrate interdisciplinary 
       knowledge as a team member of two formula student teams. There I could not only gain
        hands-on machine learning experience, but also classical algorithm design and team 
        management with the goal uniting software and hardware needs.

    title: Projects and Internships
    intro: >
      A list of internships and smaller projects I have worked on in my free time:
    assignments:
      - title: Daedalean
        link: "https://daedalean.ai/"
        tagline: "Worked in the Spotter Visual Traffic Detection Team. My main focus was on the generation of synthetic flight scenarious from real historical flight data to evaluate the intruder detection accuracy, togheter with a statistical analysis of historic flight data. Further, I worked on reducing the domain shift of simulated flight scenarios by automatic color grading. Further, I worked on an automated upload station to upload large amount of flight test data to the cloud. Lastly, I worked on the whole data evaluation pipeline and toolbox."
      - title: Formula Student
        link: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_Student"
        tagline: "Formula Student is a student engineering competition with a huge community around the globe. 
          The goal is to build an autonomous race car and compete against other university teams around the world, 
          e.g in  Hungary (FS East), Italy (FS ATA), Germany (FSG) and many more.          
          Here hundrets of student teams come together 
          and demonstrate their technological progress and developments. This is not only happening in 
          autonomous race cars but also in combustion or electric cars with drivers."

      - title: KTH Formula Student (08.2019 - 06.2020)
        link: "https://www.kthformulastudent.se/"
        tagline: "In the first year in the formula student world I learned about machine perception with the focus on LiDAR. 
          Further, did I help with team management (12 man team) and experimented with learning in the cloud with Docker."
        
      - title: AMZ (09.2020 - 09.2021)
        link: "https://driverless.amzracing.ch/en/home"
        tagline: "Stepping up the game working almost full time I joined the Formula Student Team at ETH. Here I developed a
         LiDAR color detection method via a CNN. Further, I worked a lot with Software Infrastructure, Continuous Integration
          and a custom KPI tool (Jenkins, Docker). Most valuable was to learn about the whole end-to-end integration of our 
          autonomous pipeline together with the software-hardware integration (developed automatic LiDAR calibration tool).  "

      - title: Internship Data Analysis AVM (06.2020-09.2020)
        link: "https://en.avm.de/"
        tagline: "The goal was to perform data analysis of customer support data and automatically link it to crashes and bugs. 
        Developed automated generated data summaries via Spark and Zeppelin, a tool to analyse Wifi speed tests and a tool 
        to see feature relevance via decision trees."

      - title: Wiki-Alt Text Tool
        link: "#"
        tagline: "Images on the internet have an alt text which describes the image. This is important for people with visual impairments. I worked on a tool which fetches random wikipedia images, lets the user annotate the alt text and submits the updated alt text as a change request to the wikipedia page. This way the wikipedia page can be improved and the user can help people with visual impairments."

      - title: Weather Transfer via GANs
        link: "#"
        tagline: "During the course Deep Learning I worked on a project to transfer the weather of an image to another weather. The goal was to decrease the uneven distribution of data in different weathers."

      - title: Drug Discovery via NLP and Transformers
        link: "#"
        tagline: "Used Transformers on knowledge graphs to predict new drug candidates. The goal was to predict new drug candidates for a specific disease. The knowledge graph was build from a database of drugs and their properties. The model was trained on a subset of the knowledge graph and then used to predict new drug candidates."

      - title: AR Memory Game
        link: "#"
        tagline: "Developed an AR Memory Game for Android via Unity and Vuforia. Visually impaired people can not play the normal memory game. Hence, we used other modalities to make the game playable for them. The phone vibrates gives an audio signal when the user hovers over a card."

      - title: Free Text Search in Text
        link: "#"
        tagline: "Searching Text in PDFs requires an exact match. I developed a small tool which can take in a text and it can be searched via free text queries and questions using pretrained Language models."

      - title: Remote Control LED Stribe
        link: "#"
        tagline: "Do you know these cheap LED Stribes which can light in all colors? What do you do if the battery of the remote control runs out?
        Correct you connect it to a microcontroller and build a small app to change the colors. To have even more fun you make it react to music. 
        Now you can have a party in your house with all LED Stribes being controlled from one source."

      - title: Cat Feeding Automaton
        link: "#"
        tagline: "A machine to feed your cats. That would make your life so relaxed. Thats what I thought as well hence I build a small machine
              intended to feed cats automatically. It will dispose portions perfectly for your cats without you doing anything."
